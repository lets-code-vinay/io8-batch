      I'm <small>sitting here</small> typing at <big>a table</big>. In this case
      <b>the kitchen table</b>, which is the
      <strong>largest uncluttered</strong> surface <i>in the house</i>. That's
      why I'm here. <em>Tables have it tough</em>. They're really
      underappreciated, so I'm going to take a few moments to carefully consider
      tables. I'm sure they'll be <del>happy</del> <ins>upset</ins> for it. What
      would we do in a world without tables?
      <mark>Where would we put all our stuff on</mark>
      that we can't shove into a <strike>drawer</strike> or a closet? What would
      we do about eating? Don't tell me we could eat in front of the tv. That
      requires either a coffee table, a tv table, or else awkwardly holding your
      plate. It's undignified. Eating is best done at a table. Let's think about
      the kinds of tables there are. There's kitchen tables, bedside tables, end
      tables, coffee tables, picnic tables, ping-pong tables, and pool tables
      just to name a few.
